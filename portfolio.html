    <h1> Our next project was to use visual studio code to create a unique image. We made our image to contain different shapes and different colors to make our shape look awesome. We then reacreated all of said shapes in white to create the illusion of the sahpes disappearing. We then reacreated the images a little to the right giving the illusion of teleportation. </h1>

    <h1><center> Our third project was to use visual studios to create a video game. We made the game so the player controls Mario on a cloud. The objectives of the game are to avoid Bowser who periodically flys right at you and to stamp down on the Gumbas that spawn at random intervals. You use the "w" key to go up and avoid bowser, you use the "s" key to stamp down onto the gumba which awards the player points, and finally the "d" key which allows Mario to return to his original position. <center></h1>

    <h1><center> Our fourth project was to create another video game using visual studios. We made our game to be a adventure style game where you have to answer two different riddles to reach the tresure at the end. If you answer any of the questions incorrectly your character wil fall into lava and the game will end. You use the terminal to input your answer to each riddle. <center></h1>

    <h1><center> Our fifth project was to use Scratch to create yet another video game. We decided to create a mario side-scroller game. In this game there are 3 stages you must complete to finish each was made by a different person in our group and the links can be found below. The goal of each stage is to either reach the flag pole or pipe. You control Mario with the left and right arrow keys and the space bar. Have fun! <center></h1>
