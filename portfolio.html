    <h1> Our next project was to use visual studio code to create a unique image. We made our image to contain different shapes and different colors to make our shape look awesome. We then reacreated all of said shapes in white to create the illusion of the sahpes disappearing. We then reacreated the images a little to the right giving the illusion of teleportation. </h1>

    <h1><center> Our third project was to use visual studios to create a video game. We made the game so the player controls Mario on a cloud. The objectives of the game are to avoid Bowser who periodically flys right at you and to stamp down on the Gumbas that spawn at random intervals. You use the "w" key to go up and avoid bowser, you use the "s" key to stamp down onto the gumba which awards the player points, and finally the "d" key which allows Mario to return to his original position. <center></h1>
